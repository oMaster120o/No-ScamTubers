# No-ScamTubbers  
This tool has been created as a **personal project**.   
A Huge thanks to [Incrypters](https://github.com/incrypters) who helped me build this and is providing the list of potential ScamTubers.  

As me and many others have noticed, the YouTube platform is filled with Scammers and Malware spreaders, so me and Incrypters have been working together to develop something to prevent people from falling on the baits of the platform, and also for personall use.

**Extension and Report feature no longer will be a thing, i've tried making it but due to limitations it cannot be done,
if you encounter any ScamTuber video that is not present in the list, feel free to report it on [Incrypters Discord Server](https://github.com/Incrypters/YT-ScamDatabase)**.
  
## Compatibility  
This tool may work on Windows but i personally  only tested it on Linux Mint Xfce** (Latest Version Ubuntu based).  
  
**required:   
  Python 3+

  requests(if you don't have)**  
  
## Installation
  
**I strongly recommend you reading all the code, yes, everything and make sure you know what this tool does in the minimum details**.  
It is recommended that you download the full project the way it is.  
  
clone the repo and run:  
``git clone https://github.com/oMaster120o/No-ScamTubers.git``
  
Run it **DIRECTLY** on the directory the **main.py** is at **otherwise it will break**.  

## Considerations:  
  
Don't trust any YouTuber flagged as dangerous.
